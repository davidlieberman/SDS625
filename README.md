This case study submission consists of three files and their associated 
knits: 

* `final_report.Rmd` and `final_report.pdf`
* `demo1_exploration.Rmd` and `demo1_exploration.html`
* `demo2_analysis.Rmd` and `demo2_analysis.html`

The final report summarizes and discusses the exploration and analysis of 
the data, whereas the two demos just provide the code and a handful of 
comments. The demos jointly cover the entire analysis process, and any 
interactive plots are included in the knits.
