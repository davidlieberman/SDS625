Embletta: 11.15.2011.txt
iTouch: SomnoPose-Chart-2011-11-15-222451.csv

A shirt was worn under the devices, perhaps helping keep a stable position.

Only the first part of the Embletta data file is needed; the second part may
be daytime recording by mistake.  The start/stop times for the Embletta
device are unknown.

The Embletta was first strapped securely to the torso; the iTouch was then
clipped directly to the right of the Embletta.  Care was taken to try to
position the devices as close to the center of the body as possible.
